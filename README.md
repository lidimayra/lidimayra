## Hello!! ✨

I'm a software engineer focused on web development. I work at Artsy and whenever I have some time available, I also try to share the knowledge I acquired over the years and contribute to the open source community as I can.

See below some of the activities I pushed in 2025 out of my formal work:
- 📝 [From Ruby on Rails to Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/from-ruby-on-rails-to-spring-boot) - article published on Dzone.com.
- 💬 [Web Scraping and Crawling with Python](https://scraping-slides.netlify.app) - slides for the talk I presented on PyCon Austria 2025.
- 🐛 [Fix error when running scrapy bench](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/6633) - a bugfix I submitted to the Scrapy framework.
- 💻 [Mentor @ Women Coding Community](https://www.womencodingcommunity.com/mentors?keywords=Lidiane%20Mayra%20Taquehara) -  long term relationship and ad-hoc mentorship sessions for women in tech.
- 💻 [Mentor @ Ruby Empowers](https://www.caiena.net/blog/ruby-empowers-2025) - Ruby mentorship for women on a 3 week
  program organized by [@caiena](https://github.com/caiena).

I also enjoy spending some time asking and answering questions on Stack Overflow.
