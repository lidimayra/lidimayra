## Hello!! ✨

I'm a software engineer focused on web development. I work at Artsy and whenever I have some time available, I also try to share the knowledge I acquired over the years and contribute to the open source community as I can.

See some of my recent work below:
- 📝 [From Ruby on Rails to Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/from-ruby-on-rails-to-spring-boot) - article published on Dzone.com.
- 💬 [Web Scraping and Crawling with Python](https://scraping-slides.netlify.app) - slides for the talk I presented on PyCon Austria 2025.
- 🐛 [Fix error when running scrapy bench](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/6633) - A bugfix I submitted to the Scrapy framework.

I also enjoy spending some time asking and answering questions on Stack Overflow.
